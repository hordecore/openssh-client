"The current host key, in /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key, is encrypted with the IDEA "

msgid ""
"Password authentication appears to be disabled in the current OpenSSH server "
"configuration. In order to prevent users from logging in using passwords "
"(perhaps using only public key authentication instead) with recent versions "
"of OpenSSH, you must disable challenge-response authentication, or else "

"If you disable challenge-response authentication, then users will not be "
"able to log in using passwords. If you leave it enabled (the default "
"answer), then the 'PasswordAuthentication no' option will have no useful "
"effect unless you also adjust your PAM configuration in /etc/pam.d/ssh."

"Some of the OpenSSH server host keys on this system were generated with a "
