Description: Various keepalive extensions
 Add compatibility aliases for ProtocolKeepAlives and SetupTimeOut,
 supported in previous versions of Debian's OpenSSH package but since
 superseded by ServerAliveInterval.  (We're probably stuck with this bit for
 compatibility.)
 .
 In batch mode, default ServerAliveInterval to five minutes.
 .
 Adjust documentation to match and to give some more advice on use of
 keepalives.
